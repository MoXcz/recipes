# Recipes

Redo of the previous attempts at the Odin project.

This is a small page that serves to practice basic HTML elements and structure
by using folders like `images` and `recipes`.

Following the curriculum the pages have gained styling through the `style.css`
file. Simple things like font type and size, display and the addition of `div`
containers.
